 o Minor bugfixes:
   - Fix to ignore cannibalized circuits when recording circuit build times.
     This should provide for a minor performance improvement for hidden
     service users using 0.2.2.14-alpha, and should remove two spurious
     notice log messages. Bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha; fixes bug #1740.
