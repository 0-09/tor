  o Major features (networking):
    - Add a new TokenBucketRefillInterval option to refill token buckets
      more frequently than once per second. This should improve network
      performance, alleviate queueing problems, and make traffic less
      bursty. Implements proposal 183; closes ticket 3630. Design by
      Florian Tschorsch and Bj√∂rn Scheuermann; implementation by
      Florian Tschorsch.
