  o Major features (flow control):
    - Implement authenticated SENDMEs detailed in proposal 289. A SENDME cell
      now includes the digest of the last cell received so once the end point
      receives the SENDME, it can confirm the other side's knowledge of the
      previous cells that were sent. This behavior is controlled by two new
      consensus parameters, see proposal for more details. Fixes ticket 26288.
