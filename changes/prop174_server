  o Features:
    - Servers now accept and queue data on not-yet-connected
      streams.  Previously, such data wasn't allowed.  This forced
      clients to wait for a CONNECTED cell before sending their
      data, thus adding a round trip to stream setup.  (Patch from
      Ian Goldberg; implements the server side of Proposal 174.)
