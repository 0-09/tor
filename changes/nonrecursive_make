  o Major features (build):
    - Switch to a nonrecursive Makefile structure. Now instead of each
      Makefile.am invoking other Makefile.ams, there is a master
      Makefile.am that includes the others. This makes our build process
      slightly more maintainable, and improves parallelism for building
      with make -j. Original patch by Stewart Smith; various fixes by
      Jim Meyering.

  o Minor bugfixes (documentation):
    - We no longer warn so much when generating manpages from their
      asciidoc source.

  o New requirements:
    - Tor maintainers now require Automake version 1.9 or later to build
      Tor from the Git repository. (Automake is not required when building
      from a source distribution.)
