  o Minor features
    - Make it simpler to specify "All log domains except for A and B".
      Previously you needed to say "[*,~A,~B]".  Now you can just say
      "[~A,~B]".

  o Documentation
    - Add documentation for configuring logging at different severities in
      different log domains.  We've had this feature since 0.2.1.1-alpha, but
      for some reason it never made it into the manpage.  Fixes bug 2215.
