  o Code simplification and refactoring
    - Remove the old 'fuzzy time' logic.  It was supposed to be used
      for handling calculations where we have a known amount of clock
      skew and an allowed amount of unknown skew.  But we only used it
      in three places, and we never adjusted the known/unknown skew
      values.  This is still something we might want to do someday,
      but if we do, we'll want to do it differently.
