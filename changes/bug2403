  o Minor bugfixes:
    - In the special case where you configure a public exit relay as your
      bridge, Tor would be willing to use that exit relay as the last
      hop in your circuit as well. Now we fail that circuit instead.
      Bugfix on 0.2.0.12-alpha. Fixes bug 2403. Reported by "piebeer".
