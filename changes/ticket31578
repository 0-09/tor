  o Minor bugfixes (practracker):
    - When running check-best-practices, only consider files in the
      src subdirectory.  Previously we had recursively considered
      all subdirectories, which made us get confused by the
      temporary directories made by "make distcheck".  Fixes bug
      31578; bugfix on 0.4.1.1-alpha.
