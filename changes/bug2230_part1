  o Minor bugfixes
    - When loading the microdesc journal, remember its current size.
      In 0.2.2, this helps prevent the microdesc journal from growing
      without limit on authorities (who are the only ones to use it in
      0.2.2).  Fixes a part of bug 2230; bugfix on 0.2.2.6-alpha.
      Fix posted by "cypherpunks."
