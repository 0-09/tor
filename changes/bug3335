  o Major bugfixes:

    - When an attempt to connect to a hidden service ends, consider
      refetching its hidden service descriptors from each of the HSDir
      relays responsible for them immediately.  Previously, we would
      not consider refetching the service's descriptors from each
      HSDir for 15 minutes after the last fetch; this behaviour was
      inconvenient if the hidden service was not running during the
      first attempt, for example.  Bugfix on 0.2.0.18-alpha; fixes bug
      3335.
