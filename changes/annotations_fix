  o Major bugfixes
    - Do even more to reject (and not just ignore) annotations on
      router descriptors received anywhere but from the cache.
      Previously we would ignore such annotations at first, but cache
      them to disk anyway.  Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha. Found by piebeer.

  o Minor bugfixes
    - Enforce multiplicity rules when parsing annotations.  Bugfix on
      0.2.0.8-alpha. Found by piebeer.
