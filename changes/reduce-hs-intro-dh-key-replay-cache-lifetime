  o Minor features:

    - Reduce the lifetime of elements of hidden services'
      Diffie-Hellman public key replay-detection cache from 60 minutes
      to 5 minutes.  This replay-detection cache is now used only to
      detect multiple INTRODUCE2 cells specifying the same rendezvous
      point, so we don't launch multiple simultaneous attempts to
      connect to it.
