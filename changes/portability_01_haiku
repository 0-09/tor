  o Minor buxfixes:
    - During configure, search for library containing cos function as
      libm lives in libcore on some platforms (BeOS/Haiku).
      Linking against libm was hard-coded before. Bugfix on
      0.2.2.2-alpha, fixes the first part of bug 4727. Patch and
      analysis by Martin Hebnes Pedersen.
    - Preprocessor directives should not be put inside the arguments
      of a macro. This would break compilation with GCC releases prior
      to version 3.3. We would never recommend such an old GCC
      version, but it is apparently required for binary compatibility
      on some platforms (namely, certain builds of Haiku). Bugfix on
      0.2.3.3-alpha, fixes the other part of bug 4727. Patch and
      analysis by Martin Hebnes Pedersen.
