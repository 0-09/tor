  o Minor features
    - When expiring circuits, use microsecond timers rather than one-second
      timers.  This can avoid an unpleasant situation where a circuit is
      launched near the end of one second and expired right near the
      beginning of the next, and prevent fluctuations in circuit timeout
      values.
