  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Report a SIGNAL event to controllers when acting on a delayed
      SIGNAL NEWNYM command.  Previously, we would report a SIGNAL
      event to the controller if we acted on a SIGNAL NEWNYM command
      immediately, and otherwise not report a SIGNAL event for the
      command at all.  Bugfix on 0.2.3.1-alpha; fixes bug 3349.
