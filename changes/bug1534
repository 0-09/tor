  o Minor bugfixes:
    - When we're trying to guess whether we know our IP address as
      a relay, we would log various ways that we failed to guess
      our address, but never log that we ended up guessing it
      successfully. Now add a log line to help confused and anxious
      relay operators. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha; fixes bug 1534.
