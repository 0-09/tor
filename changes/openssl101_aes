  o Major features (performance):
    - When built to use the newly OpenSSL 1.0.1, and built for an x86 or
      x86_64 instruction set, take advantage of OpenSSL's AESNI, bitsliced,
      or vectorized AES implementations as appropriate.  These can be 
      much, much faster than other AES implementations.
