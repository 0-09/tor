    - Do not log messages to the controller while shrinking buffer
      freelists.  Doing so would sometimes make the controller
      connection try to allocate a buffer chunk, which would mess
      up the internals of the freelist and cause an assertion
      failure. Fixes bug 1125; fixed by Robert Ransom. Bugfix on
      Tor 0.2.0.16-alpha.
