  o Major features (code organization):
    - Tor now includes a generic publish-subscribe message-passing subsystem
      that we can use to organize intermodule dependencies.  We hope to use
      this to reduce dependencies between modules that don't need to be
      related, and to generally simplify our codebase. Closes ticket 28226.
