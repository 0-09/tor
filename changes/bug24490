  o Minor bugfixes (bridge authority):
    - We set bridges as running in a callback which runs every 5 minutes.
      Previously, we set bridges as running in a GETINFO controller, but
      these shouldn't modify vital data structures. Fixes bug 24490;
      bugfix on 0.2.0.13-alpha. Patch by Neel Chauhan
