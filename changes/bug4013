  o Major bugfixes:
    - Allow 0.2.3.x clients to use 0.2.2.x bridges. Previously the client
      would ask the bridge for microdescriptors, which are only supported
      in 0.2.3.x and later, and then fail to bootstrap when it didn't
      get the answers it wanted. Fixes bug 4013; bugfix on 0.2.3.2-alpha.
