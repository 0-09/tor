  o Minor features
    - When we get a connection from a non-authority that tells us our
      clock is skewed, and we haven't heard about clock skew (or lack
      thereof) from an authority, launch a connection to an authority
      so we can find out whether we're really skewed.  Related to
      bug 1074.  Patch from "AltF4".
