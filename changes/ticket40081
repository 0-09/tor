  o Minor features (security):
    - Channels using obsolete versions of the Tor link protocol are no
      longer allowed to circumvent address-canonicity checks.
      (This is only a minor issue, since such channels have no way to
      set ed25519 keys, and therefore should always be rejected.)
      Closes ticket 40081.
