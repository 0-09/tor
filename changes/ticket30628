  o Major bugfixes (Flow Control, SENDME):
    - The decrement of the stream-level package window was done in a log_debug()
      statement meaning that if the debug logs were not enabled, the decrement
      would never happen and thus the window would be out of sync with the other
      end point. Fixes bug 30628; bugfix on 0.4.1.1-alpha.
