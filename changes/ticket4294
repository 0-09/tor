(NOTE: THIS SHOULD REPLACE THE TICKET 4200 ENTRY IN THE CHANGELOG)
  o Minor features:
    - The Bridge Authority now writes statistics on how many bridge
      descriptors it gave out in total, and how many unique descriptors it
      gave out. It also lists how often the most and least commonly fetched
      descriptors were given out, as well as the median and 25/75 percentile.
      Implements tickets 4200 and 4294.
