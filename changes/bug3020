  o Minor bugfixes:
    - When checking whether a hibernation period has fully elapsed, use
      the amount of seconds we expect for that period instead of using
      the new period that just started. This would cause an issue because
      February is a really short month. Bugfix on 0.2.2.17-alpha;
      fixes bug 3020.
