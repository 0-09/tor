  o Minor bugfixes:
    - When told to add a bridge with the same addr:port as a
      preexisting bridge but a different transport, change the
      transport as requested. Previously we would not notice the
      change. Fix for bug 5603; fix on 0.2.3.2-alpha.
    - When told to add a bridge with the same digest as a
