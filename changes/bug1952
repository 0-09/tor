  o Major bugfixes:
    - Alter how consensus bandwidth-weights are computed using new constraints
      that should succeed in all cases. Also alter directory authorities to not
      include the bandwidth-weights line if they fail to produce valid values.
      Fixes bug 1952; bugfix on 0.2.2.10-alpha.
