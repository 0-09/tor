  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Finally remove support for malloc_good_size and malloc_usable_size.
      We had hoped that these functions would let us eke a little more
      memory out of our malloc implementation. Unfortunately, the only
      implementations that provided these functions are also ones that
      are already efficient about not overallocation: they never got us
      more than 7 or so bytes per allocation. Removing them saves us
      a little code complexity and a nontrivial amount of code complexity.
