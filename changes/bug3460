  o Major bugfixes:

    - Ignore the timestamps of INTRODUCE2 cells received by a hidden
      service.  Previously, hidden services would check that the
      timestamp was within 30 minutes of their system clock, so that
      services could keep only INTRODUCE2 cells they had received in
      the last hour in their replay-detection cache.  Bugfix on
      0.2.1.6-alpha, when the v3 intro-point protocol (the first one
      which sent a timestamp field in the INTRODUCE2 cell) was
      introduced; fixes bug 3460.
