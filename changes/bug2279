  o Minor bugfixes
    - Avoid a double mark-for-free warning when failing to attach a
      transparent proxy connection.  Fixes bug 2279.  Bugfix on
      Tor 0.1.2.1 alpha.

  o Minor features
    - Detect attempts at the client side to open connections to private
      IP addresses (like 127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.1, and so on) with a randomly
      chosen exit node.  Attempts to do so are always ill-defined, generally
      prevented by exit policies, and usually in error.  This will also
      help to detect loops in transparent proxy configurations.
