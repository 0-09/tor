  o Privacy/anonymity features (bridge detection):
    - Introduce a new config option 'DynamicDHGroups', enabled by
      default, which provides each bridge with a unique prime DH
      modulus to be used during SSL handshakes. This option attempts
      to help against censors using the Apache DH modulus as a static
      identifier for bridges.
