  o Minor bugfixes
    - Correctly detect failures to create DNS requests when using Libevent
      versions before v2.  (Before Libevent 2, we used our own evdns
      implementation.  Its return values for Libevent's evdns_resolve_*()
      functions are not consistent with those from Libevent.) Found by
      Lodger; fixes bug 2363; bugfix on 0.2.2.6-alpha.
