  o Minor bugfixes
    - On Windows, build correctly either with or without Unicode support.
      This is necessary so that Tor can support fringe platforms like
      Windows 98 (which has no Unicode), or Windows CE (which has no
      non-Unicode). Bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha. Fixes bug 1797.
    - Fix the Windows directory-listing code.  A bug introduced in
      0.2.2.14-alpha could make Windows directory servers forget to
      load some of their cached v2 networkstatus files.

  o Testing
    - Add a unit test for cross-platform directory-listing code.
