  o Minor features (IPv6, client):
    - Make Tor clients tell dual-stack exits that they prefer IPv6
      connections. This change is equivalent to setting the PreferIPv6 flag
      on SOCKSPorts (and most other listener ports). Tor Browser has been
      setting this flag for some time, and we want to remove a client
      distinguisher at exits. Closes ticket 32637.
