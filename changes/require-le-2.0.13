  o Build changes:
    - Building Tor with bufferevent support now requires Libevent
      2.0.13-stable or later. Previous versions of Libevent had bugs
      in SSL-related bufferevents and related issues that would make
      Tor work badly with bufferevents. Requiring 2.0.13-stable also
      means that Tor with bufferevents can take advantage of Libevent
      APIs introduced after 2.0.8-rc.
