  o Build changes:
    - Building Tor with bufferevent support now requires Libevent
      2.0.13-stable or later. Previous versions of Libevent had bugs
      in SSL-related bufferevents and related issues that would make
      Tor work badly with bufferevents. Requiring 2.0.13-stable also
      means that Tor with bufferevents can take advantage of Libevent
      APIs introduced after 2.0.8-rc.

  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Use evbuffer_copyout() in inspect_evbuffer(). This fixes a memory
      leak, and lets Libevent worry about how to best copy data out
      of a buffer.
