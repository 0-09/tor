  o Minor bugfixes:

    - Don't check for whether the address we're using for outbound
      connections has changed until after the outbound connection has
      completed. On Windows, getsockname() doesn't succeed until the
      connection is finished. Fix for bug 5374; bugfix on
      0.1.1.14-alpha.
