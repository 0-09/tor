  o Minor bugfixes (security):
    - When completing a channel, relays now check more thoroughly to make
      sure that it matches any pending circuits before attaching those
      circuits. Previously, address correctness and Ed25519 identities were not
      checked in this case, but only when extending circuits on an existing
      channel. Fixes bug 40080; bugfix on 0.2.7.2-alpha.
