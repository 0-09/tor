  o Major features:
    - Add a 'tor2web mode' for clients which want to connect to hidden
      services non-anonymously (and possibly more quickly).  As a
      safety measure to try to keep users from turning this on without
      knowing what they are doing, tor2web mode must be explicitly
      enabled at compile time, and a copy of Tor compiled to run in
      tor2web mode cannot be used as a normal Tor client.  Implements
      feature 2553.
