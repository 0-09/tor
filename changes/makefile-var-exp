  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Change $(VAR:MOD) to ${VAR:MOD} -- make(1) on NetBSD substitutes
      '$(:x)' to 'x' rather than the empty string. This bites us in doc/
      when configured with --disable-asciidoc. Curly braces should work
      in all implementations of make(1) but this patch changes only the
      places where we use the VAR:MOD expansion. Doesn't fix bug 1773;
      bugfix on 0.2.2.9-alpha.
