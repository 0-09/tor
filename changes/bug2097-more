  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Fix a logic error in directory_fetches_from_authorities that
      would cause all _non_-exits refusing single-hop-like circuits to
      fetch from authorities, when we wanted to have _exits_ fetch
      from authorities.  Fix by boboper; fixes more of 2097; bugfix on
      0.2.2.16-alpha.
