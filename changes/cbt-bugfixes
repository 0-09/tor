 o Major bugfixes:
   - Ignore negative and large timeout values that can happen during a
     suspend or hibernate. These values caused various asserts to fire
     in the circuit build times code, crashing Tor. Bug 1245, bugfix on
     0.2.2.2-alpha.
   - Alter calculation of Pareto distribution parameter 'Xm' for Circuit Build
     Timeout learning to use the weighted average of the top N=3 modes. This
     should improve the timeout calculation in some cases, and prevent
     extremely high timeout values. Bug 1335, bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha.
   - Implement a filtering step to recompute synthetic build times every time
     the timeout changes. Additionally, place a lower cap on synthetic build
     times, and allow this cap to be controlled by the consensus. This should
     also improve the build time calculations, and should eliminate a case
     where Tor was allocating an excessive amount of temporary memory during
     timeout calculation. Bugs 1335 and 1245, bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha.

 o Minor bugfixes:
   - Eliminate a case where a circuit build time warning was displayed after
     network connectivity resumed.

 o Minor features:
   - Add a TIMEOUT_RATE keyword to the BUILDTIMEOUT_SET control port event,
     to give information on the current rate of circuit timeouts over our
     stored history.
   - Add ability to disable circuit build time learning via consensus
     parameter and via a LearnCircuitBuildTimeout config option. Also
     automatically disable circuit build time calculation if we are either
     a AuthoritativeDirectory, or if we fail to write our state file. Bug 1296.
