  o Minor features:
    - Be more generous with how much bandwidth we'd use up (with
      accounting enabled) before entering "soft hibernation".
      Previously, we'd hibernate once we'd used up 95% of our allotment.
      Now, we use up 95% of our allotment, AND make sure that we have
      no more than 500MB/3 hours of traffic remaining before we enter
      soft hibernation.
