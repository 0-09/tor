  o Minor features:
    - There's a new syntax for specifying multiple client ports (such as
      SOCKSPort, TransPort, DNSPort, NATDPort): you can now just declare
      multiple ...Port entries with full addr:port syntax on each.
      The old ...ListenAddress format is still supported, but you can't
      mix it with the new SOCKSPort syntax.

  o Code simplifications and refactoring:
    - Rewrote the listener-selection logic so that parsing which ports
      we want to listen on is now separate form binding to the ports
      we want.
