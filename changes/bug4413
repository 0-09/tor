  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Fix our implementation of crypto_random_hostname() so it can't
      overflow on ridiculously large inputs. (No Tor version has ever
      provided this kind of bad inputs, but let's be correct in depth.)
      Fixes bug 4413; bugfix on 0.2.2.9-alpha. Fix by Stephen Palmateer.
