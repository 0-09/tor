  o Major bugfixes:
    - When you use bridges and your network goes away and your bridges
      get marked as down, recover when you attempt a new socks connection
      (if the network is back) rather than waiting up to an hour to try
      fetching new descriptors for your bridges. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha;
      fixes bug 1981.
