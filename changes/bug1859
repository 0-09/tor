  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Bring the logic that gathers routerinfos and assesses the
      acceptability of circuits into line. This prevents a Tor OP from getting
      locked in a cycle of choosing its local OR as an exit for a path (due to
      a .exit request) and then rejecting the circuit because its OR is not
      listed yet. Also prevent Tor clients from using an OR running in the same
      instance as an exit (due to a .exit request) if the OR does not meet the
      same requirements expected of an OR running elsewhere.
      Fixes bug 1859; bugfix on 0.2.0-alpha.
