  o Code simplifications and refactorings:
    - Remove the pure attribute from all functions that used it previously.
      In many cases this we assigned it incorrectly, because the functions
      might assert or call impure functions, and we don't have evidence
      that keeping the pure attribute is worthwhile. Implements changes
      suggested in ticket 4421.
