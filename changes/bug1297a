  o Major bugfixes:
    - Apply circuit timeouts to opened hidden-service-related circuits
      based on the correct start time.  Previously, we would apply the
      circuit build timeout based on time since the circuit's
      creation; it was supposed to be applied based on time since the
      circuit entered its current state.  Bugfix on 0.0.6; fixes part
      of bug 1297.
