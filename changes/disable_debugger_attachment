  o Minor features:
    - If set to 1, Tor will attempt to prevent basic debugging
      attachment attempts by other processes. It has no impact for
      users who wish to attach if they have CAP_SYS_PTRACE or if they
      are root.  We believe that this feature works on modern
      Gnu/Linux distributions, and that it may also work on OSX and
      some *BSD systems (untested).  Some modern Gnu/Linux systems
      such as Ubuntu have the kernel.yama.ptrace_scope sysctl and by
      default enable it as an attempt to limit the PTRACE scope for
      all user processes by default. This feature will attempt to
      limit the PTRACE scope for Tor specifically - it will not
      attempt to alter the system wide ptrace scope as it may not even
      exist. If you wish to attach to Tor with a debugger such as gdb
      or strace you will want to set this to 0 for the duration of
      your debugging. Normal users should leave it on. (Default: 1)
