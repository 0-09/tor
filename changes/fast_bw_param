  o Minor features (directory authority):
    - Provide two consensus parameters (FastFlagMinThreshold and
      FastFlagMaxThreshold) to control the range of allowable bandwidths for
      the Fast directory flag. This allows authorities to run better
      experiments on appropriate requirements for being a "Fast" node.
      The AuthDirFastGuarantee flag still applies.
