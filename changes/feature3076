  o Minor features
    - The options SocksPort, ControlPort, and so on now all accept an
      optional value "auto" that opens a socket on an OS-selected port.
  o Minor features (controller)
    - GETINFO net/listeners/(type) now returns a list of the addresses
      and ports that are bound for listeners for a given connection
      type.  This is useful for if the user has selected SocksPort
      "auto", and you need to know which port got chosen.
