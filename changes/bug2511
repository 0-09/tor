  o Major bugfixes:
    - If you configured Tor to use bridge A, and then quit and
      configured Tor to use bridge B instead, it would happily continue
      to use bridge A if it's still reachable. While this behavior is
      a feature if your goal is connectivity, in some scenarios it's a
      dangerous bug. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.1-alpha; fixes bug 2511.
