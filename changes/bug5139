  o Minor features (bridges):
    - Tag a bridge's descriptor as "never to be sent
      unencrypted". This shouldn't matter, since bridges don't open
      non-anonymous connections to the bridge authority and don't
      allow unencrypted directory connections from clients, but we
      might as well make sure. Closes bug 5139.
