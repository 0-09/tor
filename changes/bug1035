  o Minor features (authorities)
    - Take altered router IPs into account when determining router stability.
      Previously, if a router changed its IP, the authorities would not
      treat it as having any downtime for the purposes of stability
      calculation, whereas clients would experience downtime since the
      IP could take a while to propagate to them.  Resolves issue 1035.
