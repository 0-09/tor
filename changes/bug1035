  o Minor features (authorities)
    - Take altered router IP addresses and ORPorts into account when
      determining router stability.  Previously, if a router changed
      its IP or ORPort, the authorities would not treat it as having
      any downtime for the purposes of stability calculation, whereas
      clients would experience downtime since the change could take a
      while to propagate to them.  Resolves issue 1035.
  o Minor bugfixes (authorities)
    - Try to be more robust to hops back in time when calculating
      router stability.  Previously, if a run of uptime or downtime
      appeared to be negative, the calculation could give incorrect
      results.  Bugfix on 0.2.0.6-alpha.
