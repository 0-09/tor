  o Minor features (circuit padding):
    - Allow the padding machine designer to pick the edges of their histogram
      instead of trying to compute them automatically using an exponential
      formula. Resolves some undefined behavior in the case of small histograms
      and allows greater flexibility on machine design. Closes ticket 29298;
      bugfix on 0.4.0.1-alpha.
