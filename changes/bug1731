  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Our libevent version parsing code couldn't handle versions like
      1.4.14b-stable and warned the user about using an old and broken
      version of libevent. Treat 1.4.14b-stable like 1.4.14-stable when
      parsing the version. Fixes bug 1731; bugfix on 0.2.2.1-alpha.
