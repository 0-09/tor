  o Minor features:
    - Directory authorities now do an immediate reachability check as soon
      as they hear about a new relay. This change should slightly reduce
      the time between setting up a relay and getting listed as running
      in the consensus. It should also improve the time between setting
      up a bridge and seeing use by bridge users.
