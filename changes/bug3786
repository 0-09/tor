  o Major features:
    - Implement support for clients connecting to private bridges over
      IPv6. Bridges still need at least one IPv4 address in order to
      connect to other relays. Currently, adding Bridge lines with
      both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address to the same bridge will most
      probably result in the IPv6 address not being used. Implements
      parts of proposal 186.
