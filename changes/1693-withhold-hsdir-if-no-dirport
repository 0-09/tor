  o Major bugfixes:
    - Stop assigning the HSDir flag to relays that disable their
      DirPort (and thus will refuse to answer directory requests). This
      fix should dramatically improve the reachability of hidden services:
      hidden services and hidden service clients pick three HSDir relays
      to store and retrieve the hidden service descriptor, and currently
      about half of the HSDir relays will refuse to work. Bugfix on
      0.2.0.10-alpha; fixes part of bug 1693.
