  o Minor bugfixes
    - Publish a router descriptor even if generating an extra-info
      descriptor fails.  Previously we would not publish a router
      descriptor without an extra-info descriptor; this can cause fast
      exit relays collecting exit-port statistics to drop from the
      consensus.  Bugfix on 0.1.2.9-rc; fixes bug 2195.
