  o Major bugfixes:
    - Don't update the AccountingSoftLimitHitAt state file entry whenever
      tor gets started. This prevents a wrong average bandwidth estimate,
      which would cause relays to always start a new accounting interval at
      the earliest possible moment. Fixes bug 2003; bugfix on 0.2.2.7-alpha.
      Reported by BryonEldridge, who also helped immensely in tracking this
      bug down. Thanks!
