  o Minor features:
    - Raise the threshold of server descriptors needed (75%) and exit
      server descriptors needed (50%) before we will declare ourselves
      bootstrapped. This will make clients declare completion a little
      later, but makes the initially constructed circuits less weird
      and less in conflict with directory connections. Fixes ticket
      #3196.
