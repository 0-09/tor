  o Minor bugfixes
    - Ignore the TunnelDirConns option when determining which HSDir
      relays are responsible for a hidden service descriptor ID.
      Currently, clients and hidden services with TunnelDirConns off
      will skip over HSDir relays which do not advertise a DirPort
      when making a list of HSDirs responsible for a descriptor ID,
      even though they would never try to use a HSDir's DirPort to
      upload or fetch a hidden service descriptor.  Fixes bug 2722;
      bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.
