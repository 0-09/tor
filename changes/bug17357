  o Minor bugfixes (onion services):
    - If we are relaunching a circuit to a rendevous service in
      rend_service_relaunch_rendezvous() and hs_service_requires_uptime_circ()
      is true, the CIRCLAUNCH_NEED_UPTIME flag is added to the circuit.
      Previously, we only set this flag when we received a INTRODUCE2
      cell in rend_service_receive_introduction(). Fixes bug 17357;
      bugfix on 0.4.0.2-alpha. Patch by Neel Chauhan
