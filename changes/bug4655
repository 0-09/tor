  o Minor bugfixes:

    - If we can't attach streams to a rendezvous circuit when we
      finish connecting to a hidden service, clear the rendezvous
      circuit's stream-isolation state and try to attach streams
      again.  Previously, we cleared rendezvous circuits' isolation
      state either too early (if they were freshly built) or not at
      all (if they had been built earlier and were cannibalized).
      Bugfix on 0.2.3.3-alpha; fixes bug 4655.
