  o Minor features:
    - If ExitNodes is set, still pay attention to the Fast/Stable
      status of exits when picking exit nodes.  (We used to ignore
      these flags when ExitNodes was set, on the grounds that people
      who set exitnodes wanted all of those nodes to get used, but
      with the ability to pick exits by country and IP range, this
      doesn't necessarily make sense any more.)
