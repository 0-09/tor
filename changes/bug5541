  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Prevent a null-pointer dereference when receiving a data cell
      for a nonexistent stream when the circuit in question has an
      empty deliver window. We don't believe this is triggerable,
      since we don't currently allow deliver windows to become empty,
      but the logic is tricky enough that it's better to make the code
      robust. Fixes bug 5541; bugfix on 0.0.2pre14.
