  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Testsuite:  In the util/threads test no longer free the test_mutex
      before all worker threads have finished.
    - Testsuite:  The master thread could starve the worker threads quite
      badly on certain systems, causing them to run only partially in
      the allowed window.  This resulted in test failures.  Now the master
      thread sleeps occasionally for a few microseconds while the two
      worker-threads compete for the mutex.
