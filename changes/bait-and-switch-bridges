  o Minor bugfixes:
    - If you run a bridge that listens on multiple IP addresses, and
      some user configures a bridge address that uses a different IP
      address than your bridge writes in its router descriptor, and the
      user doesn't specify an identity key, their Tor would discard the
      descriptor because "it isn't one of our configured bridges", and
      fail to bootstrap. Now believe the descriptor and bootstrap anyway.
      Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.
