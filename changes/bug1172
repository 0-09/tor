  o Minor bugfixes:
    - When we restart our relay, we might get a successful connection
      from the outside before we've started our reachability tests,
      triggering a warning: "ORPort found reachable, but I have no
      routerinfo yet. Failing to inform controller of success." This
      bug was harmless unless Tor is running under a controller
      like Vidalia, in which case the controller would never get a
      REACHABILITY_SUCCEEDED status event. Bugfix on 0.1.2.6-alpha;
      fixes bug 1172.
