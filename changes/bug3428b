  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Abort if tor_vasprintf fails in connection_printf_to_buf (a
      utility function used in the control-port code).  This shouldn't
      ever happen unless Tor is completely out of memory, but if it
      had happened and Tor somehow recovered from it, Tor could have
      sent a log message to a control port in the middle of a reply to
      a controller command.  Fixes part of bug 3428.
