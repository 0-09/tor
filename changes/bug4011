  o Major bugfixes:

    - Do not allow the presence of one consensus flavor to keep us from
      downloading another. Previously, we had one "time to download a
      consensus" timer, which didn't understand the idea of having one
      consensus but wanting to download another. Fixes bug 4011; fix on
      0.2.3.1-alpha.
