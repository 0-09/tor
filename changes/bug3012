  o Minor features:
    - Relays can go for weeks without writing out their state file. A
      relay that crashes would lose its bandwidth history (including
      capacity estimate), client country statistics, and so on. Now relays
      checkpoint the file at least every 12 hours. Addresses bug 3012.
