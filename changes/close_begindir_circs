  o Major bugfixes:
    - Relays now close idle circuits early if it looks like they were
      intended for directory fetches. Such circuits are unlikely to
      be re-used, and tens of thousands of them were piling up at the
      fast relays, causing the relays to run out of sockets and memory.
      Bugfix on 0.2.0.22-rc (where clients started tunneling their
      directory fetches over TLS).
