  o Removed features:

    - Remove support for clients claiming to support any standard
      ciphersuites that we can actually provide.  (As of modern
      OpenSSL versions, it's not necessary to fake any standard
      ciphersuite, and doing so prevents us from using better
      ciphersuites in the future, since servers can't know whether an
      advertised ciphersuite is really supported or not.)  Some
      hosts--notably, ones with very old versions of OpenSSL or where
      OpenSSL has been built with ECC disabled-- will stand out
      because of this change; TBB users should not be affected.
      This implements the client side of proposal 198.
