  o Major bugfixes:

    - When one of a hidden service's introduction points appears to be
      unreachable, stop trying it.  Previously, we would keep trying
      to build circuits to the introduction point until we lost the
      descriptor, usually because the user gave up and restarted Tor.
      Partly fixes bug 3825.
