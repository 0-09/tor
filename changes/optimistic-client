  o Major features:
    - When using an exit nodes running 0.2.3.1-alpha and later,
      clients can now "optimistically" send data on a stream before
      the exit node reports that the stream has opened. This can save
      a round trip when starting connections with protocols where the
      client speaks first. This behavior is controlled by a (currently
      disabled) networkstatus consensus parameter. To turn it on or
      off manually, use the "OptimisticData" torrc option.  Implements
      proposal 181; code by Ian Goldberg.
