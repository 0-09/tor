  o Code simplifications and refactoring:
    - Rename Tor functions that turn strings into addresses, so that
      "parse" indicates that no hostname resolution occurs, and
      "lookup" indicates that hostname resolution may occur. This
      should help prevent mistakes in the future. Fixes bug 3512.
