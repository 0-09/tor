  o Removed features (relay):
    - Because DirPorts are only used on authorities, relays no longer
      advertise them. Similarly, self-testing for DirPorts has been disabled,
      since an unreachable DirPort is no reason for a relay not to advertise
      itself. (Configuring a DirPort will still work, for now.)  Closes
      ticket 40282.
