  o Major bugfixes:
    - When we deprecated the v2 directory protocol, we accidentally
      got rid of the only way that v3 authorities can hear from each
      other about other descriptors. So many relays have been falling
      out of the consensus lately because not enough authorities know
      about their descriptor for them to get a majority of votes. Now
      authorities examine every v3 vote for new descriptors, and fetch
      them from that authority. Bugfix on 0.2.1.23.
