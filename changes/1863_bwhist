  o Minor bugfixes
    - Fix a bug in banwidth history state parsing that could have been
      triggered if a future version of Tor ever changed the timing
      granularity at which bandwidth history is measured.  Bugfix on
      Tor 0.1.1.11-alpha.
    - Correctly clear out dir_read/dir_write history when there is an
      error parsing any bw history value from the state file. Bugfix on
      Tor 0.2.2.15-alpha.
