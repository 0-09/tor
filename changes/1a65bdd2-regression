  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Fix a regression introduced in 0.2.2.7-alpha that marked relays
      down if a directory fetch fails and you've configured either
      bridges or EntryNodes. The intent was to mark the relay as down
      _unless_ you're using bridges or EntryNodes, since if you are
      then you could quickly run out of entry points.
