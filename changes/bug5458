 o Minor features
   - Issue a notice if a guard completes less than 40% of your circuits.
     Threshold is configurable by torrc option PathBiasNoticeRate
     and consensus parameter pb_noticepct. There is additional, off-by-
     default code to disable guards which fail too many circuits.
     Addresses ticket 5458.
