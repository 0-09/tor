  o Minor bugfixes:

    - Don't put "TOR_PT_EXTENDED_SERVER_PORT=127.0.0.1:4200" in a
      managed pluggable transport server proxy's environment.
      Previously, we would put it there, even though Tor doesn't
      implement an 'extended server port' yet, and even though Tor
      almost certainly isn't listening to that address.  Bugfix on
      0.2.3.6-alpha.
