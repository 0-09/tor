  o Minor bugfixes (performance):
    - When checking a node for bridge status, use a fast check to make sure
      that its identity is set. Previously, we used a constant-time check,
      which is not necessary when verifying a BUG() condition that causes
      a stack trace. Fixes bug 30308; bugfix on 0.3.5.1-alpha.
