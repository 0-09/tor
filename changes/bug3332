  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Assert that hidden-service-related operations are not performed
      using single-hop circuits.  Previously, Tor would assert that
      client-side streams are not attached to single-hop circuits, but
      not that other sensitive operations on the client and service
      side are not performed using single-hop circuits.  Fixes bug
      3332; bugfix on 0.0.6.
