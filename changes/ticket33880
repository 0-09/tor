  o Minor bugfixes (relay, usability):
    - Adjust the rules for when to warn about having too many connections
      to other relays. Previously we'd tolerate up to 1.5 connections
      per relay on average.  Now we tolerate more connections for directory
      authorities, and raise the number of total connections we need
      to see before we warn.  Fixes bug 33880; bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.
