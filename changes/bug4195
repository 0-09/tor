  o Minor features:
    - Enhance our internal sscanf replacement so that we can eliminate
      the last remaining uses of the system sscanf. (Though those uses
      of sscanf were safe, sscanf itself is generally error prone, so
      we want to eliminate when we can.) Fixes ticket 4195 and Coverity
      CID 448.
