  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Detect and reject certain misformed escape sequences in configuration
      values. Previously, these values would cause us to crash if received
      in a torrc file or over an (authenticated) control port. Patch by
      Esteban Manchado Vel√°zquez. Fix for bug 5090; bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha.
