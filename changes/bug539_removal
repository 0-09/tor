  o Removed code
    - Removed workaround code to handle directory responses from
      servers that had bug 539 (they would send HTTP status 503
      responses _and_ send a body too).  Since only server versions
      before 0.2.0.16-alpha/0.1.2.19 were affected, there is no longer
      reason to keep the workaround in place.
