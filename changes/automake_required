  o Build changes
    - Our build system requires automake 1.6 or later to create the
      Makefile.in files.  Previously, you could have used 1.4.
      This only affects developers and people building Tor from git;
      people who build Tor from the source distribution without changing
      the Makefile.am files should be fine.
