  o Major bugfixes:
    - Raise the default BandwidthRate/BandwidthBurst values from 1MB/5MB
      to 1GB/1GB. The previous defaults were intended to be "basically
      infinite", but it turns out they're now limiting our 100mbit+
      relays and bridges. Fixes bug 6605; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha (the
      last time we raised it).
