  o Minor bugfixes (IPv6, relay):
    - Consider IPv6 addresses when checking if a connection is canonical.
      In 17604, relays assumed that a remote relay could consider an IPv6
      connection canonical, but did not set the canonical flag on their side
      of the connection. Fixes bug 33899; bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.
