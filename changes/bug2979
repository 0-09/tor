  o Minor bugfixes:
    - If the Nickname configuration option wasn't given, Tor used to pick
      a nickname based on the local hostname as the nickname for a relay.
      Because nicknames are not very important in today's Tor and the
      "Unnamed" nickname has been implemented, this is now problematic
      behaviour: It leaks information about the hostname without being
      useful at all. Bugfix on tor-0.1.2.2-alpha, which introduced the
      Unnamed nickname. Fixes bug 2979, reported by tagnaq.
