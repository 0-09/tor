  o Minor bugfixes:

    - Don't close hidden service client circuits which have almost
      finished connecting to their destination when they reach the
      normal circuit-build timeout.  Previously, we would close
      introduction circuits which are waiting for an acknowledgement
      from the introduction-point relay and rendezvous circuits which
      have been specified in an INTRODUCE1 cell sent to a hidden
      service after the normal CBT; now, we mark them as 'timed out',
      and launch another rendezvous attempt in parallel.  This
      behaviour change can be disabled using the new
      CloseHSClientCircuitsImmediatelyOnTimeout option.  Fixes part of
      bug 1297.

    - Don't close hidden-service-side rendezvous circuits when they
      reach the normal circuit-build timeout.  Previously, we would
      close them.  This behaviour change can be disabled using the new
      CloseHSServiceRendCircuitsImmediatelyOnTimeout option.  Fixes
      the remaining part of bug 1297.
