  o Minor bugfixes:

    - When one of a hidden service's introduction points times out,
      consider trying it again during the next attempt to connect to
      the HS.  Previously, we would not try it again unless a newly
      fetched descriptor contained it.  Required by fixes for bugs
      1297 and 3825.
