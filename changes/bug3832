  o Major features:

    - Allow Tor controllers like Vidalia to obtain the microdescriptor
      for a relay by identity digest or nickname.  Previously,
      microdescriptors were only available by their own digests, so a
      controller would have to ask for and parse the whole
      microdescriptor consensus in order to look up a single relay's
      microdesc.  Fixes bug 3832; bugfix on 0.2.3.1-alpha.
