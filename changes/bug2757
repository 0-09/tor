  - Minor bugfixes
    o Avoid a double-mark-for-free warning when failing to attach a
      transparent proxy connection.  (We thought we had fixed this in
      0.2.2.23-alpha, but it turns out our fix was checking the wrong
      connection.)  Fixes bug 2757; bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha (the original
      bug) and 0.2.2.23-alpha (the incorrect fix).
