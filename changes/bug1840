  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Allow handshaking OR connections to take a full KeepalivePeriod
      seconds to handshake.  Previously, we would close them after
      IDLE_OR_CONN_TIMEOUT seconds, as if they were open.  This is a
      bugfix on 0.2.1.26.  Thanks to mingw-san for analysis help.  Fixes
      bug 1840.
