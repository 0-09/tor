  o Minor bugfixes (rate limiting, bridges, pluggable transports):
    - On a bridge, treat all connections from an ExtORPort as remote
      by default for the purposes of rate-limiting. Previously,
      bridges would treat the connection as local unless they explicitly
      received a "USERADDR" command.  ExtORPort connections still
      count as local if there is a USERADDR command with an  explicit local
      address. Fixes bug 33747; bugfix on 0.2.5.1-alpha.
