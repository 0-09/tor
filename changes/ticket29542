  o Minor features (defense in depth):
    - Tor now uses a fast cryptographically strong PRNG even for decisions
      that we do not believe are security-sensitive.  Previously, for
      performance reasons, we had used a trivially predictable linear
      congruential generator algorithm for certain load-balancing and
      statistical sampling decisions. Now we use our fast RNG in those cases.
      Closes ticket 29542.
