  o Major bugfixes:
    - Allow routers to correctly detect their own DirPorts as running.
      When we removed support for versions_supports_begindir, we also
      accidentally removed the mechanism we used to self-test our
      DirPort. Diagnosed with help from kargig. Fixes bugs 6814 and
      6815; bugfix on 0.2.4.2-alpha.
