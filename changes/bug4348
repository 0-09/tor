  Privacy fixes:
    - Bridges no longer include their address in NETINFO cells on outgoing
      OR connections, to allow them to blend in better with clients.
      Removes another avenue for enumerating bridges. Reported by
      "troll_un". Fixes bug 4348; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha, when NETINFO
      cells were introduced.
