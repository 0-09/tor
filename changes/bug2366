  o Minor bugfixes
    - When a relay decides that its DNS is too broken for it to serve
      as an exit server, it advertised itself as a non-exit, but
      continued to act as an exit.  This could create accidental
      partitioning opportunities for users.  Instead, if a relay is
      going to advertise reject *:* as its exit policy, it should
      really act with exit policy "reject *:*". Fixes bug 2366.
      Bugfix on Tor 0.1.2.5-alpha.  Bugfix by user "postman" on trac.
