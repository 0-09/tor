  o Minor bugfixes
    - Alter directory authorities to always consider Exit-flagged nodes
      as potential Guard nodes in their votes. The actual decision to
      use Exits as Guards is done in the consensus bandwidth weights.
      Fixes bug 1294; bugfix on 0.2.2.10-alpha.

 o Minor features:
    - Lower the maximum weighted-fractional-uptime cutoff to 98%. This
      should give us approximately 40-50% more Guard-flagged nodes.
