  o Major bugfixes:
    - Make relays more aggressive about closing TLS connections that
      have no circuits on them. Tens of thousands of them were piling
      up at the fast relays, causing the relays to run out of sockets
      and memory. Bugfix on 0.2.0.22-rc (where clients started tunneling
      their directory fetches over TLS).
