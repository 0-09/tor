  o Minor features:
    - Directory authorities no longer launch a TLS connection to every
      relay as they startup. Now that we have 2k+ descriptors cached,
      the resulting network hiccup is becoming a burden. Besides,
      authorities already avoid voting about Running for the first half
      hour of their uptime.
