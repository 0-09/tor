  o Minor bugfixes:

    - Increase the maximum length of microdescriptor we are willing to
      generate from 1K to 2K. Occasionally this is needed for routers
      with complex policies or family declarations. Partial fix for
      bug 6404; fix on 0.2.2.6-alpha.

    - Authorities no longer include any router in their
      microdescriptor consensuses for which they couldn't generate or
      agree on a microdescriptor.  Partial fix for bug 6404; fix on
      0.2.2.6-alpha.
