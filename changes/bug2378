  o Minor bugfixes
    - Correctly detect failure to allocate an OpenSSL BIO.  Fixes bug 2378;
      found by "cypherpunks".   This bug was introduced before the
      first Tor release, in svn commit r110.

  o Minor code simplifications and refactorings
    - Always treat failure to allocate an RSA key as an unrecoverable
      allocation error.
