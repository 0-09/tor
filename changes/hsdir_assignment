  o Security fixes:
    - Directory authorities now use data collected from rephist when
      choosing whether to assign the HSDir flag to relays, instead of
      trusting the uptime value the relay reports in its descriptor.
      This helps prevent an attack where relatively few malaicious
      nodes can blackhole any given hidden service. Bugfix on
      0.2.0.10-alpha; fixes bug 2709.
