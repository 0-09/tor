  o Code refactorings
    - Unified our node-listing and selecting logic.  We had at least
      two major ways to look at the question of "which Tor servers do
      we know about": our list of router descriptors, and the current
      consensus.  We're adding a third in microdescriptors.  Having
      so many systems without an abstraction layer over them was
      hurting the codebase.  Now, we have a new "node_t" abstraction
      that presents a consistent interface to a client's view of
      a Tor node, and holds (nearly) all of the mutable state
      formerly in routerinfo_t and routerstatus_t.
