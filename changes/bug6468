  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Remove some now-needless code that tried to aggressively flush
      OR connections as data was added to them. Since 0.2.0.1-alpha,
      our cell queue logic has saved us from the failure mode that
      this code was supposed to prevent. Removing this code will limit
      the number of baroque control flow paths through Tor's network
      logic.  Reported pseudonymously on IRC.  Fix for bug 6468;
      bigfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.
