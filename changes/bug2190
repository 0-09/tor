  o Minor bugfixes
    - Prevent calls from Libevent from inside Libevent log handlers.
      This had potential to cause a nasty set of crashes, especially if
      running Libevent with debug logging enabled, and running Tor
      with a controller watching for low-severity log messages.
      Bugfix on 0.1.0.2-rc.  Fixes bug 2190.
    - Make Libevent log messages get delievered to controllers later,
      and not from inside the Libevent log handler.  This prevents
      unsafe reentrant Libevent calls while still letting the log
      messages get through.
