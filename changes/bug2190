  o Minor bugfixes
    - Prevent calls from Libevent from inside Libevent log handlers.
      This had potential to cause a nasty set of crashes, especially if
      running Libevent with debug logging enabled, and running Tor
      with a controller watching for low-severity log messages.
      Bugfix on 0.1.0.2-rc.  Fixes bug 2190.
