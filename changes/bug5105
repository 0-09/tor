  o Minor bugfixes:

    - Ensure that variables set in Tor's environment cannot override
      environment variables which Tor tries to pass to a managed
      pluggable-transport proxy.  Previously, Tor would pass every
      variable in its environment to managed proxies along with the
      new ones, in such a way that on many operating systems, the
      inherited environment variables would override those which Tor
      tried to explicitly set.  Bugfix on 0.2.3.12-alpha for most
      Unixoid systems; bugfix on 0.2.3.9-alpha for Windows.
