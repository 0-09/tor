  o Minor bugfixes (onion services, performance):
    - If we are building circuits to onion services, in circuit_is_acceptable()
      we only call tor_addr_parse() in places where we use the returned
      family and address values from this function. Previously, we called
      tor_addr_parse() in circuit_is_acceptable() even if it wasn't used.
      This change will improve performance when building circuits. Fixes
      bug 22210; bugfix on 0.2.8.12. Patch by Neel Chauhan
