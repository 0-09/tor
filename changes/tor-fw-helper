  o Major features:
    - Tor now has the ability to wrangle NAT devices like a good network cowbot
      with the tor-fw-helper tool. The tor-fw-helper tool supports Apple's
      NAT-PMP protocol and the UPnP standard for TCP port mapping. This
      optional tool may be enabled at compile time by configuring with
      '--enable-upnp' or '--enable-natpmp' or with both. This tool may be
      called by hand or by Tor.  By configuring the PortForwarding option, Tor
      will launch the helper on a regular basis to ensure that the NAT mapping
      is regularly updated.  Additionally, a user may also specify an
      alternative helper by using the PortForwardingHelper option. The helper
      may be specified by name or with the full path to the helper. The default
      helper is named 'tor-fw-helper' and any alternative helper must take the
      tor-fw-helper-spec.txt into account.
