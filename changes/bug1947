  o Minor features:
    - Add new "perconnbwrate" and "perconnbwburst" consensus params to
      do individual connection-level rate limiting of clients. The torrc
      config options with the same names trump the consensus params, if
      both are present. Replaces the old "bwconnrate" and "bwconnburst"
      consensus params which were broken from 0.2.2.7-alpha through
      0.2.2.14-alpha. Closes bug 1947.
