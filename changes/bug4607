  o Minor bugfixes:

    - Don't launch more than 10 (service-side) introduction-point
      circuits for a hidden service in five minutes.  Previously, we
      would consider launching more introduction-point circuits if at
      least one second had passed without any introduction-point
      circuits failing.  Fixes bug 4607; bugfix on 0.0.7rc1.
