  o Changed parameters (authorities):
    - Authorities are now a little more lenient at accepting older
      router descriptors, or newer router descriptors that don't make
      big changes. This should help ameliorate past and future issues
      where routers think they have uploaded valid descriptors, but the
      authorities don't think so. Fix for ticket 2479.
