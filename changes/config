  o Minor features
    - Slightly change behavior of "list" options (that is, options that
      can appear more than once) when they appear both in torrc and on
      the command line. Previously, the command-line options would be
      appended to the ones from torrc. Now, the command-line options
      override the torrc options entirely. This new behavior allows
      the user to override list options (like exit policies and
      ports to listen on) from the command line, rather than simply
      appending to the list.
    - You can get the old (appending) command-line behavior for "list"
      "list" options, by prefixing the option name with a "+".
    - You can remove all the values for a "list" option from the command
      line without adding any new ones by prefixing the option name
      with a "/".
    - Add *experimental* support for a "defaults" torrc file to be parsed
      before the regular torrc. Torrc options override the defaults file's
      options in the same way that the command line overrides the torrc.
      The SAVECONF controller command saves only those options which differ
      between the current configuration and the defaults file. HUP reloads
      both files. (Note: This is an experimental feature; its behavior will
      probably be refined in future 0.2.3.x-alpha versions to better meet
      packagers' needs.)

  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Restore behavior of overriding SocksPort, ORPort, and similar
      options from the command line. Bugfix on 0.2.3.3-alpha.
