  o Minor features
    - Slightly change behavior of "list" options (that is, options that
      can appear more than once) when they appear both in torrc and on
      the command line. Previously, the command-line options would be
      appended to the ones from torrc. Now, the command-line options
      override the torrc options entirely. This new behavior allows
      the user to override list options (like exit policies and
      ports to listen on) from the command line, rather than simply
      appending to the list.

  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Restore behavior of overriding SocksPort, ORPort, and similar
      options from the command line. Bugfix on 0.2.3.3-alpha.
