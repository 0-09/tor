  o Major bugfixes:
    - Fix a bug where bridge users who configure the non-canonical
      address of a bridge automatically switch to its canonical
      address. If a bridge listens at more than one address, it should be
      able to advertise those addresses independently and any non-blocked
      addresses should continue to work. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.x. Fixes
      bug 2510.
