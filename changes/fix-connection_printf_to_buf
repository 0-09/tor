  * Code simplifications and refactoring:

    - Make connection_printf_to_buf's behaviour sane.  Its callers
      expect it to emit a CRLF iff the format string ends with CRLF;
      it actually emits a CRLF iff (a) the format string ends with
      CRLF or (b) the resulting string is over 1023 characters long or
      (c) the format string does not end with CRLF ''and'' the
      resulting string is 1021 characters long or longer.  Bugfix on
      0.1.1.9-alpha; fixes bug 3407.
