  o Major features:

    - Tor clients and bridges can now be easily configured to use a
      separate 'transport' proxy. This approach helps to resist
      censorship by allowing bridges to use protocol obfuscation
      plugins. It implements the 'managed proxy' part of proposal
      180. Implements ticket #3472.
