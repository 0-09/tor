 o Refactorings:
   - Make it explicit that we don't cannibalize one-hop circuits. This happens
     in the wild, but doesn't turn out to be a problem because we fortunately
     don't use those circuits. Many thanks to outofwords for the initial
     analysis and to swissknife who confirmed that two-hop circuits are
     actually created.
