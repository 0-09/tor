  o Major bugfixes (directory authority):
    - Check more thoroughly to prevent a rogue authority from
      double-voting on any consensus directory parameter.  Previously,
      authorities would crash in this case if the total number of votes
      for any parameter exceeded the number of active voters, but would
      let it pass otherwise.  Partial fix for bug 5786; bugfix on
      0.2.2.2-alpha.
