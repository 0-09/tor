  o Minor features:

    - New "DisableNetwork" option to prevent Tor from launching any
      connections or accepting any connections except on a control
      port. Some bundles and controllers want to use this so they can
      configure Tor before letting Tor talk to the rest of the
      network--for example, to prevent any connections from being made
      to a non-bridge address.
