@brief lib/crypt_ops: Cryptographic operations.

This module contains wrappers around the cryptographic libraries that we
support, and implementations for some higher-level cryptographic
constructions that we use.

It wraps our two major cryptographic backends (OpenSSL or NSS, as configured
by the user), and also wraps other cryptographic code in src/ext.
