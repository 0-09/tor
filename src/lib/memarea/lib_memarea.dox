@brief lib/memarea: A fast arena-style allocator.

This module has a fast "arena" style allocator, where memory is freed all at
once.  This kind of allocation is very fast and avoids fragmentation, at the
expense of requiring all the data to be freed at the same time.  We use this
for parsing and diff calculations.
